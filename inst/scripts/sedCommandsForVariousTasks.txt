## Blocking commits using package.conf
## Need to block RELEASE_X_Y 2-3 weeks before release
## Need to block master on day of release
## Example uses RELEASE_3_15 as current/tobe frozen
## with upcoming release 3.16

## NOTE: this works on packages.conf
##  check gitolite.conf to block core team/admin commits


## block release 
sed -i '/ RELEASE_3_15 /s/^/#/' packages.conf
## block master
sed -i '/ master /s/^/#/' packages.conf 
## block devel
sed -i '/ devel /s/^/#/' packages.conf 
## disable hook for bump and branch
sed -i '/ hook.pre-receive /s/^/#/' packages.conf


## To reinstate and change to new release
sed -i '/ RELEASE_3_15 /s/^#//' packages.conf
sed -i '/ master /s/^#//' packages.conf 
sed -i '/ devel /s/^#//' packages.conf 
sed -i 's/RELEASE_3_12/RELEASE_3_16/' packages.conf
sed -i 's/RELEASE_3_15/RELEASE_3_16/' packages.conf
sed -i '/ RELEASE_3_16 /s/^#//' packages.conf
sed -i '/ hook.pre-receive /s/^#//' packages.conf





##  Instead of Removing with rm -r over git.bioconductor package repo
##  To allow team members to bump and branch
##  Try using the hooks exclusion file
##
##  Copy Original File
##  Run these commands and push up new file
##  Once complete delete and reinstate original
